# Kerala University Spoarts app
This is a streamlit app developed for organizing the annual sports event called **Campus Olympics** at University of Kerala. The app will help us to first collect the data of participants who are willing to participate in the several sports evnts that are to be conducted here at the university. The web app willl be the only place where candidates can register to compete in the events. The form that is in this web app will be directly connected to a google sheet. We use the **gspread** library in python and the api service provided by google to make this connection possible. The next thing that the app is going to do is provide is help the orgaanizers by providing them with the list of participants in each item. The house leadrs will also learn about who all are paarticipating from their house. This tab of the web app will be password protected and only  those few people with autorization will be able to see this information. The next thing is we will provide 2 windows where the result of events and leader board will be displayed. This leaderboard will also be connncected to another google sheet and when we update that sheet, the result here will also get updated
